# UNVEILING WINE QUALITY PREDICTION

## Overview:
  Wine, a beverage with deep cultural heritage, symbolizes elegance, festivity, and culinary creativity. Leading wine-producing regions include France, the United States, Italy, and Spain. Classifying wines by quality is challenging due to the subjective nature of taste, traditionally evaluated by human tasters. Accurate wine quality assessment is crucial for both the wine industry and consumers. Machine learning offers a promising alternative, enhancing the speed and accuracy of quality evaluation. This research aims to identify key characteristics for predicting wine quality using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, GaussianNB, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier. Among these, the Random Forest Classifier is found to be the most accurate, making it the preferred model for wine quality prediction.


## Business Problem:

  The Wine’s quality is often assessed by professionals at the end of the process. However, the companies must put money and
manpower to the production process. Companies use a variety of wine combinations to fulfill
the expectations of a wider customers and to produce high quality wine. But the process was
always finalized with the validation of wine quality. The company will lose time, money, and
effort, if they change wine production combination and it will end up with lower standard wines.
Wine producers can use technology like machine learning algorithms to obtain a preliminary
outcome prior to the initial phase of manufacturing. Production companies could save money
as well as time by using these technologies. The aroma and flavor characteristics of wine
strongly impact its quality. The taste, aroma, color, and other qualities of wine are determined
by its chemical composition.

## Dataset
  The machine learning community has gathered a sizable number of datasets for use in
research investigations, which are included in this data store. We are examining the Portuguese
red and white wines of the Vinho Verde varietal, specifically the “Wine Quality” dataset which
is available on the Kaggle platform. The dataset for the wine quality has 6497 instances and 12
instances. There is just one output feature implemented despite the consideration of eleven
input features. Sensory data served as the foundation for the output features, which were rated
in an 11-step quality feature system, with 0 denoting very bad quality and 10 denoting very good
quality. Physiochemical tests were used to gather the input data features.

## Conclusion:
  It is evident that greater alcohol, more sulphate, lower volatile acidity, and higher
residual sugar levels are associated with higher quality wines. Customers who wish to purchase
and taste wine of a better calibre may now learn how to forecast the calibre of wine by
understanding these outcomes. A wine with a larger proportion of the physiochemical
characteristics associated with better quality and a smaller proportion of the traits associated
with poorer quality might be sought after. Producing wines with qualities that more people would
like and that are of greater quality will pique the attention of wine makers as well. Many machine
learning strategies for wine quality prediction may be studied in the future using a huge dataset.
